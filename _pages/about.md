I am currently in my fifth year as a Ph.D. student in the THUIAR group with State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technology and Systems, Department of Computer Science and Technology (DCST), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. Under the guidance of Prof. [Hua Xu](https://thu-xuhua.github.io/), my research primarily focuses on open set recognition, clustering, multimodal machine learning, and multimodal large language models.

My research focuses on analyzing the cognitive-level semantics (e.g., intention) in human-system and human-human interactions in real-world complex environments. These interactions involve challenges related to open-world scenarios (e.g., open-set recognition, out-of-distribution detection, and novel-category discovery), multimodal data (e.g., multimodal fusion and representation), and low-resource settings (e.g., unsupervised and semi-supervised learning). To address these challenges, I have made foundational and pioneering contributions in the fields of natural language processing and multimodal machine learning. Specifically, I have published 9 first-author papers in top-tier AI journals and conferences (e.g., ICLR, IEEE TKDE, ACL, AAAI, IEEE TMM, ACM MM, and IEEE/ACM TASLP), which have been cited over 530 times on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PS5KVSQAAAAJ&hl=en). A selection of my representative open-source works is listed below.

* **Benchmark**: Multimodal Language Analysis for Large Language Models: [MMLA](https://github.com/thuiar/MMLA)
* **Datasets**: Multimodal Intent Recognition Series Datasets: [MIntRec](https://github.com/thuiar/MIntRec) and [MIntRec2.0](https://github.com/thuiar/MIntRec2.0)
* **Platforms**: Text Open Intent Recognition: [TEXTOIR](https://github.com/thuiar/TEXTOIR), Multimodal Intent Analysis: [MMIA](https://github.com/thuiar/mmia)
* **Reading List**: Open Knowledge Discovery: [OKD-Reading-List](https://github.com/thuiar/OKD-Reading-List)
