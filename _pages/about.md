I am a researcher at Hisilicon Kirin AI, Huawei Technologies, selected for the "[Top Minds](https://career.huawei.com/reccampportal/portal5/topminds.html)" Program. My work focuses on lightweight and high-performance multimodal large language models in real applications. Prior to this, I received my PhD degree from the State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technology and Systems in the Department of Computer Science and Technology (DCST) at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, working with Prof. [Hua Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oyOaLDEAAAAJ&hl=en). I'm also interested in open set recognition, clustering, and multimodal machine learning. 

During my PhD, my research focused on analyzing cognitive-level semantics (e.g., intention) in human-system and human-human interactions within real-world complex environments. These interactions involve challenges related to open-world scenarios (e.g., open-set recognition, out-of-distribution detection, and novel-category discovery), multimodal data (e.g., multimodal fusion and representation), and low-resource settings (e.g., unsupervised and semi-supervised learning). To address these challenges, I made foundational and pioneering contributions, ranging from datasets and benchmarks to algorithms and platforms in natural language processing and multimodal machine learning. These contributions include 10 first-author full papers published in top-tier AI journals and conferences (e.g., ICLR, NeurIPS, IEEE TKDE, ACL, AAAI, IEEE TMM, ACM MM, and IEEE/ACM TASLP), which have been cited over 660 times on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PS5KVSQAAAAJ&hl=en). I was honored to be a recipient of the **Chinese Information Processing Society of China (CIPS) Doctoral Dissertation Award** in 2025 (Top 10 nationwide).  My systematic research works are listed below.
