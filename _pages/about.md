I am now a fourth year Ph.D. student in THUIAR group, the Department of Computer Science and Technology (DCST) at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. My supervisor is Prof. [Hua Xu](https://thu-xuhua.github.io/). My research interests lie in open knowledge discovery and multimodal machine learning. My research goal is analyzing textual and multimodal human intentions in real-world scenarios.
