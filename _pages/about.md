I am now a first year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. My supervisor is Prof. [Hua Xu](http://www.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/iar/members/xuhua.htm). My research interests lie in knowledge discovery. My research goal is to discover new intents in dialogue system.
